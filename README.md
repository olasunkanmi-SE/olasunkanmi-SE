# Hi, I'm Oyinlola Olasunkanmi Raymond 👋

As a software engineer, I am driven by a passion for designing and developing robust, innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what we know. My current areas of focus include blockchain, generative AI, and distributed systems.

I am keenly interested in system design, particularly in enhancing system performance. I am also an advocate of continuous integration and development. 

I subscribe to the philosophy of "break things as you go", which emphasizes the importance of embracing calculated risk-taking and iterative learning in the pursuit of excellence
